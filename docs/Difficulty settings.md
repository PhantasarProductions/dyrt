# Difficulty settings

The game has technically three difficulty settings. Easy, casual and hard. A lot of people have asked me about my earlier RPG productions why the difficulty can't be changed after you set it, like many other games allow.
The big difference between my RPG games and the games they are referring to, is that in those games the only difference between the difficulty settings is how aggressive the AI of the enemies as set, and sometimes even a few 
statistics determining their strength and stuff. My RPG games, including this remake of Dyrt, has a much more sophisticated approach than that, and changing from easy to hard would effectively be a form of cheating or even be 
leading to conflicts, simply because the effects go way beyond just the difficulty and strength of the enemies. Let's break it all down shall we.

## Easy

This mode is for inexperienced players only, or those who do like to view the story line but don't seek much challenge in the gameplay. Many things have been havely simplefied or more set into your advantage.

## Casual

This mode shows the game the way I origininally intended it to be.

## Hard

If it's a hard game you want, a hard game you'll get. Some people just hate easy games and seek challenges beyond the impossible. Are you the kind of player who beats Final Fantasy X without using the sphere grid? Or Mana Khemia 
without using your growth books? Who thinks Breath of Fire Dragon Quarter is too easy? Then this may be the difficulty setting for you. Many limits and extra handicaps have been put into the game, just to annoy the crap out of you 
and make sure you'll be suffering from loss of hair and high blood pressure and tons of stress (for which I hereby disclaim all resposibility).

## Table of matters

The table below goes more into the deep of matters:


Stuff | Easy | Casual | Hard
---|---|---|---
Buy prices in shop | 25% cheaper (never less than 1) | ... | 25% more expensive
Sell prices in shop | As high as buying prices | 25% less of buying price (never less than 1) | 75% less of buying price (never less than 1)
Experience | More than casual | ... | Less than casual
Experience for non-competitors | Same | Half | None
Experience fallen characters | Half | None | None
Experience penalty for repeatitive enemeies | None | None | The more times you meet the same enemy, the less experience it will grand you.
Money loss losing battle* | Doesn't happen | Money not in bank halved | All money not in bank gone
Max number per item | 50 | 25 | 5
Experience penalty for losing battle | None | None | Depending on your level, you may need a lot more experience to gain the next level
Random Encounter Frequency | Low | Normal | High




* = "Bound to lose fights", in other words fights that must be lost due to scenario reasons do no count for this rule
