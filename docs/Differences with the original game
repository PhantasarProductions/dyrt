A lot of suggestions came about this game and Star Story on how to improve the game. Particularly Darkblood Bane gave me a lot of cool suggestions, which could not be put in the original game anymore due to the way that game was coded (thanks alot, Darkblood Bane).

When I began Star Story I was so pleased with how much I had done better than Dyrt that I actually regretted the way Dyrt was ever since, and thus this remake.

Here is a small list of a few things that I did to make this game better than the original.

- The BlitzMax language appears neglected, and the LAURA engine was written in that language. I fear that if I ever need to recompile that engine in Windows I'll be in big big trouble. And thus I created a new engine called NALA written in C# using the .NET framework
- Portability to Linux should be better as a result. Technically C# cannot compile to Linux compatibles, but thanks to the Mono project the game SHOULD work (although no technical support can be given that way, as I cannot test this).
- In stead of JCR5 this Dyrt uses JCR6 and in stead of zlib, it uses lzma. If this leads to smaller files remains to be seen, but it should count for something.
- The Travel Emblem system as used in the original game never reached my satisfaction. Thus I'll replace it with the system I used in The Fairy Tale REVAMPED.
- As a result, this game will just like TFT REVAMPED have a flexible level cap, depending on how many Travel Emblems you found, and this also prevents "overgrinding"
- Honno suggested when he judged Star Story that the screen sizes should be more flexible and not be bound to 800x600. Starting with The Fairy Tale REVAMPED I could work out how to deal with multiple screen settings, and this version of Dyrt just automatically adepts to your system settings. 
- Dark Bloodbane wanted me to list out all requirements for characters to unlock new spells/skills/special abilities. This will definitely be done in this game.
- Just like Star Story and TFTREVAMPED, Experience gains will be instant, meaning you can gain levels halfway a fight, and even for passing certain points in the game.
- NALA supports both Teddybear and Kthura. Due to this I can leave the maps I'm happy about the way they are and can redo the maps that need reworking, in Kthura. It's also not unthinkable some maps will be converted to Kthura in order to allow some extra improvement to them. A full list of maps redone and maps remaining will be created as the works go on.
- The quick interface basis as present in Star Story and The Fairy Tale REVAMPED shall now also be used here.
- The possibility to enter the names of the playable characters will be removed, this because I want it to be easy to add voice acting if I can find enough voice actors to actually do the job.
- Extra content can be unlocked by Game Jolt users who are logged in to Game Jolt by means of the API. 
- The time guage in battle will get a complete recalculation of how fast the heroes and the enemies move, this to prevent the ridiculous changes in speed, but still allow me to keep certain enemies a lot faster than you are. This also to be more in line with the card based interface TFTREVAMPED uses, and to balance the game out more properly.
- Better support for facial expressions will be put in the code. If you'll see actual effect of this remains to be seen, but at least there are possibilities here now.
- I do have ideas to reduce the number of temporary files, or at least the frequency in which they are written. This most of all to save the hard ware of people whose home directory is set on an SSD drive (which is quite common these days).
- The changes between the two versions of the game do not make it possible to use the save game files of the original in this remake, but I am willing to make people with a save game file that has been saved in either the final dungeon or in a New Game+ to make this game version runnable in New Game+ mode from the start, and those who unlocked the True Abyss should also be able to start it immediately.
- The Jukebox will feature all music pieces of the game. Plan is to only feature those you've heard at least once in game.
- Due to the more flexible screen settings, all battle arena are likely in need to be redone, I'll be looking into how to do this best.
- Plans are to make the new system compatible with accent marks and umlauts making translations to German and French and more languages possible. All I need now is somebody with enough understanding of these languages to do the actual translation.
- There is even a plan to provide the possibility to have the game with the Phantasar Common Language is scenario language. It's only depending on how much work this will be and how much I can schedule in, if this will really happen, but hey, the plan is there, and was originally already planned for the original version, but scheduling issues prevented me from doing it.

This may not cover everything, but it does cover the most notable differences.
