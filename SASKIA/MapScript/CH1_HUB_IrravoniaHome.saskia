:Prologue
	;Technically this script is all that required this room, as the 
	;player will NEVER enter this place again.
	
	;It's no problem that "PROLOGUE_START" gets overridden now
	;That scenario is no longer needed, and this way the memory
	;will also be cleaned up. SASKIA runs in Lua after all and
	;Lua features a GARBAGE collector
	call BoxText.Load,"GENSCEN/CH1/STARTIRRAVONIA","PROLOGUE_START"
	
	;And Let's fire things up
	;Shouldn't be needed, but just to make sure
	mov "GANG",FieldMap.Kthura.Layer
	call BoxText,"PROLOGUE_START","I"
	mov "HUISKAMER",FieldMap.Kthura.Layer
	call BoxText,"PROLOGUE_START","J"
	mov "GANG",FieldMap.Kthura.Layer
	call FieldMap.Kthura.Kill,"Irravonia",false
	call GoToSleep,4000
	mov "HUISKAMER",FieldMap.Kthura.Layer
	call BoxText,"PROLOGUE_START","K"
	
	;And lastly let's chain to the forest
	call Field.ChainMap,"CH1_DUNG_XENORBUSHES","Prologue"
