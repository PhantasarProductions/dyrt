This wil be the folder used for my "SASKIA" scripts. These can be used for some tiny scripts for which a serial approach is key. Unfortunately the way the underlying framework that I am dependent on has been set up is not very 
friendly on this approach, making RPG games next to impossible, or at least MAJOR HELL! The SASKIA system has to help here. That's basically it!
