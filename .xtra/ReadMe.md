# The .xtra folder

This folder contains stuff the game itself does not need. The "." prefix makes it hidden in Unix systems, and the Bubble builder has been configured to ignore those files because of that, and that I placed in that . so I could still dump this in my repository for you to see.

These are most of all images and stuff for the websites that will host Dyrt.NET, such as Game Jolt and itch.io
