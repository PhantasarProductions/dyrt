# Trouble

Some things may go wrong, or may confuse you, here are some common issues, and what to do about them


## I already have the amount of kills needed for an achievement, yet I did not get it

Many achievements are automated to respond to certain variable settings, however checking contineously would spook up the game's FPS, and the game is already pretty demanding the way it is.
That's why achievements checking the number of kills, amount of cash or if bosses are defeated or not are only checked at fixed intervals and that can take several minutes, causing a bit of a delay. The achievement should be awarded eventually.

It's by the way safe to make a savegame and terminate the game when waiting for an achievement that was not yet awarded even though the requirements were met. After loading the savegame, the achievement checker will after a short wait make be triggered and award all delayed achievements anyway.

Achievements based on scenarios are overall awarded immediately. 


## I cannot transfer savegames from the original game into this version?

No unfortunately not. The differences between the two games is simply too big. The games may in first impression look the same only with an upgraded UI, but the truth is that a complete new engine was written and that the game was entirely recoded from scratch and even most of the maps have been redesigned in order to take full advantage of the Kthura Map System... Transferring would in all kinds of way be impossible because of that. 

## Does this game run on Mac or Linux?

Official versions for these systems are not planned. Since the game uses the .NET framework I can investigate if I can get the game running on Linux through Mono, but that is NOT a promise. Linux and I were never good friends.

# What should I do? The game crashes or contains bugs....

I spend a lot of time on making sure the game is bug-free, but it's impossible to be 100% bug-free (yes even professional software is NEVER bug-free, and if the company developing that software does claim it is, I'd run away from that company as they are then obviously swindlers). I do have [a bug tracker on Github](https://github.com/PhantasarProductions/dyrt.net/issues) which I set up to allow you to report bugs. Describe in as much detail as you can what you did and how the system responded. If you see purple numbers in the lower left corder, they refer to the number of the room in a dungeon... When the bug handles something in a specific dungeon these numbers can be worth gold to me to track stuff down sooner. It may be possible I ask for log screenshots when you have an error. If you press F1 when an error message appears you'll see this log. It contains very much boring nerdy stuff, but it can tell me what went wrong (hopefully).

# The game doesn't let me log in on Game Jolt

Check the following:
- Did you enter your correct username and token?
- Did you enter your token and NOT your password? (NEVER enter your password!!!)
- Is your internet connection working well?
- Is Game Jolt itself working well and is there no trouble on the server?
- You did not change your username or token after creating a new game session? (For security reasons the game will then no longer be able to access Game Jolt).
- If your account on Game Jolt gets banned or deleted by a moderator, you won't be able to log in onto Game Jolt through this game either. As the developer of this game I cannot take responsibility for what the Game Jolt staff does (not even if I would ever be a staff member myself or not).
