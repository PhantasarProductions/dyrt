# Script/Use

These contain some routines which can help the game on several departments. Think of them as a kind of libraries, although they are specific to this game. The actual libraries that could be used for any project are in the "Libs/" 
folder however you cannot find that in the git repositories as they are not part of this project, and automatically implemented by the Bubble Builder.
