# Logging into Game Jolt with this game

## How to do
All you need to be doing this is an active account on Game Jolt (I think it's only obvious that accounts that are deleted or banned won't work).

- You log in with your USERNAME and TOKEN at the start of the game, please note that this game won't allow you to change this afterward, and your credentials are written into your savegames, so best is NOT to share those savegame 
files.
- Please note, NEVER and I repeat NEVER enter your PASSWORD. This won't work!

## What benefits does it bring

1. First of all, both the original Secrets of Dyrt game, and this remake have tons of achievements or trophies to unlock. Unfortunately at the time this document was written nobody but you can see that, but hey, they are cool 
nonetheless.
2. Second, the game will try your enthusiam for my games, and based on your unlocked achievements on as well this game, as my other productions, you can unlock 4 extra secret dungeons, and obtain stuff in there that can really be 
helpful. On the moment this document was written the games in question are:
   - This game itself
   - The original Secrets of Dyrt
   - BallPlay Cupid
   - Cynthia Johnson
   - Star Story
   - The Fairy Tale REVAMPED
   - Who is the virus?

## Privacy

The game only saves your credentials into your savegame files in order to log on to Game Jolt again when you continue the game, nothing is being sent to me, or any other website than Game Jolt. What Game Jolt does with any data 
sent by the game is subject to Game Jolt's own privacy statements. (On the moment this document was written they can be found [here](https://gamejolt.com/privacy)).

## Some notes:

When your Game Jolt accounts gets banned or otherwise deleted or inactive or whatever, this game cannot retrieve any data from Game Jolt anymore. The Dungeons you already unlocked in any savegame files you have will remain unlocked 
however, the GJ bonus dungeons you didn't yet unlock will not be unlockable anymore. On the moment this document was written I was not a staff member of Game Jolt (anymore), so I cannot be held responsible for any account blocks 
leading to the 
loss of the beneifts this game provides with it, and should I ever become a Game Jolt staff member (again) I cannot allow my judgment to be influenced by how my games work, also meaning that I cannot be held responsible in that 
kind of scenario. 

Should the Game Jolt servers be inoperative the same scenario applies as for banned accounts, then the dungeons you already have remain open, but the GJ dungeons that require a GJ account will remain locked. The game's written in a 
way though that if you start the game at a time the Game Jolt servers are back up and running, unlocking should be possible again (providing your account is still active, of course).
